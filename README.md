## What is Chainflip? 
Chainflip is a game-changing protocol for native cross-chain swaps design using Just In Time liquidity. This results in more competition for the LPs which translates to better prices for the users. Chainflip swap has a wallet-agnostic feature which means no KYC and not IP address tracking.
